# üéì GPA Calculator ‚Äì Python Tkinter GUI

This is a desktop GUI application built with **Python** and **Tkinter**, designed to calculate **semester GPA** based on user input for course names, grades, and credit values.

The UI was initially designed using **Figma** and converted to functional Python code using **Tkinter Designer**. Logic and features were then added using Python and `tkinter.ttk`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python** | Core programming language |

## üß© What is Tkinter Designer?

**[Tkinter Designer](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer)** is an open-source tool that allows developers to design GUI layouts using **Figma**, and then export them directly to **Tkinter Python code**. This saves time and allows modern UI design with less manual layout coding.

### üß™ How it worked in this project:
1. The layout was built visually in Figma.
2. Exported using Tkinter Designer as `.py` with asset folders.
3. Python logic (GPA calculation, button actions) was manually added to the generated base code.
